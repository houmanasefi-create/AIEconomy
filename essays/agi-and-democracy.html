    <h1>AGI Arms Control Before the Blast Radius</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Why AGI governance must be built like nuclear arms control—before anyone admits we have AGI</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>The Core Thesis</h2>
    <div class="thesis-box">
        <p>AGI governance will not emerge from ethics panels, global kumbaya, or post-disaster regret. It will emerge—if it emerges at all—through arms-control logic applied to compute, supply chains, and deployment power, layered <em>before</em> catastrophe. The choice is not between "regulation vs innovation," but between pre-catastrophe creative layering and post-catastrophe creative destruction—with democracy as the collateral damage if we get it wrong.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This isn't a moral argument. It's an economic and political one. And if you don't build the system now, the system that gets built after catastrophe won't be the one you want.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Creative Layering vs. Creative Destruction: The Core Frame</h2>

    <p>Historical governance failures share a pattern: we wait for destruction before coordination. The nuclear era worked differently—not because humans suddenly became wise, but because layering happened <em>before</em> total catastrophe, not after Hiroshima-level repeat events.</p>

    <p>AGI is different in substrate, not in power dynamics. Waiting for an AGI catastrophe to regulate is like waiting for a second Hiroshima to invent arms control—except this time the blast radius is cognitive, institutional, and irreversible.</p>

    <p>The substrate doesn't matter. The power law does. And power without constraint doesn't negotiate—it imposes.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Why "AGI Governance" Fails as Currently Framed</h2>

    <p>Most AGI governance proposals fail before they start. Here's why:</p>

    <p><strong>Philosophical AGI definitions.</strong> Useless, unfalsifiable, and politically manipulable. You can't regulate a concept. You regulate training runs, compute thresholds, and deployment contexts.</p>

    <p><strong>Ethics-first governance.</strong> Unenforceable, vibes-based, and captured by incumbents. Ethics without enforcement is just PR with better fonts.</p>

    <p><strong>UN-first multilateralism.</strong> Consensus theater without enforcement power. The UN can't stop a border skirmish. It sure as hell can't stop a compute race.</p>

    <p><strong>Hard claim:</strong> Anything that doesn't regulate compute, deployment, and chokepoints is governance cosplay. Everything else is a PowerPoint deck with footnotes.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. The Nuclear Analogy—Used Correctly</h2>

    <p>AGI is not nuclear weapons. But arms control logic is the only governance logic that has ever worked at this scale of power.</p>

    <p><strong>What actually transfers from nuclear arms control:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Chokepoints matter more than intentions.</strong> You don't inspect good faith. You inspect enrichment facilities.</p>

    <p><strong>Verification beats trust.</strong> Trust is cheap. Tamper-evident logs are expensive. Build for the expensive one.</p>

    <p><strong>Narrow, survivable cooperation beats utopian coordination.</strong> The NPT didn't require universal love. It required mutual survival incentives.</p>

    <p><strong>Institutions precede universality.</strong> You don't wait for everyone to agree. You start with the players that matter, then universalize.</p>

    <p><strong>What does not transfer:</strong></p>

    <p>Inspecting "the thing itself." Atoms are physical. Code is not. You verify through infrastructure: compute, chips, cloud capacity.</p>

    <p>One-time treaties. AGI capabilities ratchet. Governance must ratchet with them.</p>

    <p>Clear state-only actors. AGI labs are corporate, transnational, and privately funded. The Cold War map doesn't apply.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. The Pre-Catastrophe Governance Stack: 10 Steps to Build the International AGI Oversight Agency (IAOA)</h2>

    <p>This is not a thought experiment. This is the practical sequence for building a functional AGI governance regime before catastrophe forces a worse one.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Define What You're Regulating (The Fissile Material Moment)</h3>

    <p>Don't try to define "AGI" philosophically. Define regulated capabilities and regulated training runs.</p>

    <p><strong>Example categories:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frontier training runs above a compute threshold (e.g., 10^26 FLOP)</li>
        <li>Systems that can autonomously replicate/scale, execute cyber offense, or produce biological weaponization guidance</li>
        <li>Models deployed to critical infrastructure, elections, or military command support</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the "what counts as fissile material" moment. If you miss it, everything else collapses into definitional warfare.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Build a Small "P5-for-AI" Steering Group First</h3>

    <p>Nuclear governance worked because it started with the powers that mattered most. For AGI, start with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>US + China (mandatory—if they're not in, you have nothing)</li>
        <li>Compute chokepoint states: Taiwan, South Korea, Netherlands, Japan (ASML, TSMC, semiconductor supply chain)</li>
        <li>Major cloud infrastructure holders: US (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), potentially EU</li>
        <li>EU/UK for legitimacy and regulatory coordination</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Agree on minimum rules even while competing. This is cynical but true: if the leaders aren't in, it's cosplay.</p>

    <p>If the actors with the largest clusters aren't inside the tent, you don't have governance—you have a press release.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Do a "Geneva Convention" Phase Before an "NPT" Phase</h3>

    <p>This is your pre-catastrophe trick: go for ban lists first, not full control. Red lines are politically easier to sign than comprehensive treaties.</p>

    <p><strong>Red lines to lock early:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No fully autonomous nuclear launch or strategic command decisions</li>
        <li>No mass-surveillance citizen scoring systems exported as "governance tech"</li>
        <li>No election-scale persuasion systems without mandatory labeling and audit trails</li>
        <li>Mandatory incident reporting for frontier model failures (like aviation black boxes)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You need something that can be signed <em>before</em> the world agrees on everything. Start narrow. Ratchet upward.</p>

    <h3>Step 4: Create the Institution—The International AGI Oversight Agency (IAOA)</h3>

    <p>A permanent body with technical teeth, not a UN discussion club.</p>

    <p><strong>Structure:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Technical Inspectorate:</strong> Real engineers and safety evaluators, not diplomats cosplaying as technical experts</p>

    <p><strong>Standards & Evals Division:</strong> Defines tests, model cards, safety baselines. Think FDA approval process, not ethics checklist.</p>

    <p><strong>Compute & Supply-Chain Office:</strong> Tracks chips, large clusters, cloud capacity. This is where enforcement lives.</p>

    <p><strong>Public Accountability Arm:</strong> Democracy layer—disclosures, hearings, reports. Without this, you get safety authoritarianism.</p>

    <p><strong>Key design choice:</strong> It must be able to do audits and verify claims, not just publish principles. The IAEA can inspect enrichment facilities. The IAOA must be able to inspect training runs.</p>

    <h3>Step 5: Verification—Make It About Compute + Process, Not "Reading Code"</h3>

    <p>Nuclear inspections work because atoms are physical. AGI is mostly digital, so you verify through chokepoints:</p>

    <p><strong>Compute registration:</strong> Any training run above threshold must be registered, like declaring enrichment facilities. No exceptions.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-party evals:</strong> Standardized capability and safety tests run by accredited labs, like safeguards inspections. Not self-reported. Not voluntary.</p>

    <p><strong>Secure logging:</strong> Tamper-evident logs of large training runs. Hardware-level attestation where possible. Think flight recorders, not honor system.</p>

    <p><strong>Model release controls:</strong> Controlled access for certain capability classes, plus post-deployment monitoring. You can't unrelease a model, but you can control distribution.</p>

    <p>This avoids the fantasy that inspectors will "inspect the source code" and understand it. Code inspection is a red herring. Compute inspection is real.</p>

    <h3>Step 6: Enforcement—Trade and Chips, Not Morality</h3>

    <p>Nuclear governance has missiles in the background. AGI governance has supply chains.</p>

    <p><strong>Enforcement mechanisms that actually bite:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Compute embargoes:</strong> Deny advanced chips, interconnects, and manufacturing tools to violators. ASML lithography machines don't grow on trees.</p>

    <p><strong>Cloud service restrictions:</strong> Deny high-end training capacity. If you can't rent 10,000 H100s, you can't train frontier models.</p>

    <p><strong>Cross-border model distribution limits:</strong> Frontier model weights licensing. Control who gets access to the payload.</p>

    <p><strong>Sanctions on entities, not just states:</strong> Target labs, executives, shell orgs. Corporate actors matter as much as national ones.</p>

    <p><strong>Blunt truth:</strong> AGI enforcement isn't about morality. It's about who gets GPUs.</p>

    <h3>Step 7: Incentives—The "AGI for Peace" Package</h3>

    <p>Without benefit-sharing, your treaty becomes a cartel. You need reasons for countries to join even if they're not leaders.</p>

    <p><strong>What to offer:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Access to safety tools:</strong> Eval suites, secure deployment frameworks, alignment research</p>

    <p><strong>Subsidized compute:</strong> For approved public-interest models in education, health, disaster response</p>

    <p><strong>Joint research programs:</strong> On alignment, interpretability, and containment—shared infrastructure, shared risk reduction</p>

    <p><strong>Capacity building:</strong> So smaller democracies aren't permanently dependent vassals in an AI caste system</p>

    <p>Without this, AGI governance becomes a permanent technological caste system. And caste systems don't last—they collapse or get overthrown.</p>

    <h3>Step 8: Democratic Oversight—Make Legitimacy a First-Class Feature</h3>

    <p>This is where most governance proposals quietly become authoritarian. Safety without democracy is just technocracy with better PR.</p>

    <p><strong>Concrete mechanisms:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Mandatory public risk reports:</strong> For frontier systems, with classified annexes as needed. Transparency is the price of legitimacy.</p>

    <p><strong>Parliamentary/Congressional hearings:</strong> For major incidents and major deployments. Not theater. Real accountability.</p>

    <p><strong>Protected whistleblower channels:</strong> With legal protection and institutional support. Because the people inside know first.</p>

    <p><strong>Standing civil society review panel:</strong> With real access, not PR access. Independent technical expertise from outside the labs.</p>

    <p><strong>Election integrity rules:</strong> Provenance, labeling, and auditability for political content at scale. Democracy can't survive AI-generated epistemic collapse.</p>

    <p><strong>Core principle:</strong> Democracy survives when power has visible constraints and recourse. Without democratic oversight, AGI governance will be imposed, not negotiated. And what gets imposed won't be what you want.</p>

    <h3>Step 9: Emergency Protocol—Your "Chernobyl Moment" Without the Chernobyl</h3>

    <p>Coordination fails most when it's needed most—unless it's rehearsed in advance.</p>

    <p><strong>What you need:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Shared definition of "AGI incident":</strong> Model escape, autonomous replication, major cyber event, critical infrastructure disruption, mass persuasion leak</p>

    <p><strong>24–72 hour mandatory reporting window:</strong> Fast disclosure. No cover-ups. No "we're still investigating."</p>

    <p><strong>International rapid response team:</strong> Technical containment + communications discipline. Pre-trained, pre-authorized.</p>

    <p><strong>Temporary "pause triggers":</strong> For specific classes of training runs after severe incidents. Narrow, not global. Surgical, not sweeping.</p>

    <p>This is how you get coordination before catastrophe: pre-agreed emergency choreography. When the incident happens, you execute the playbook. You don't improvise.</p>

    <h3>Step 10: Lock-In—Ratchet the Regime Upward Over Time</h3>

    <p>This isn't static. Capabilities ratchet. Governance must ratchet with them.</p>

    <p><strong>Phased escalation:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Red lines + incident reporting</p>
    <p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Registration + evals for frontier runs</p>
    <p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Full verification + export control alignment</p>
    <p><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Binding limits on certain capability classes</p>
    <p><strong>Phase 5:</strong> Broader membership + stronger benefit-sharing</p>

    <p>Each phase builds on the last. Each phase expands scope and deepens enforcement. You don't wait for perfection. You iterate toward control.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. The Private Sector Problem: Who Controls the Labs?</h2>

    <p>Major AI labs aren't just national—they're corporate, transnational, and privately funded. This is different from nuclear, where states controlled the infrastructure.</p>

    <p><strong>The solution:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Mandatory registration:</strong> Labs must register large training runs with the IAOA. Not voluntary. Compulsory.</p>

    <p><strong>Inspections:</strong> Labs face compute audits just like states. They're de facto stakeholders, but they don't get a veto.</p>

    <p><strong>Regulated like utilities:</strong> Frontier AI development is infrastructure, not just commerce. Infrastructure gets regulated. Always has.</p>

    <p>The alternative is corporate sovereignty over civilizational risk. That's not a libertarian paradise. It's just stupid.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>6. Rogue Actors and Fragmented Enforcement</h2>

    <p>What happens when smaller states or rogue actors try to develop AGI under the radar?</p>

    <p><strong>The answer:</strong> Embed monitoring in global supply chains. Chips, cloud infrastructure, and compute capacity are physical bottlenecks. Control the chokepoints.</p>

    <p><strong>Enforcement:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coordinate embargoes on violators through the IAOA</li>
        <li>Deny access to advanced chips (ASML lithography, TSMC fabs)</li>
        <li>Restrict cloud compute capacity for unregistered actors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This won't catch everyone. But it raises the floor. And raising the floor buys time.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>7. The Exit Strategy: What If AGI Is Less Dangerous Than We Think?</h2>

    <p>Every governance regime needs an off-ramp. Otherwise it becomes a permanent bureaucracy out of touch with reality.</p>

    <p><strong>The exit strategy:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>If AGI proves less dangerous than anticipated, phase down inspections</li>
        <li>Focus governance on specific high-risk applications: critical infrastructure, military command, election systems</li>
        <li>Maintain emergency response capacity but scale routine enforcement to match actual risk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal isn't permanent control. It's proportional control. But you don't get to proportional control without building the infrastructure first.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>8. The Brutal Realities You Must Say Out Loud</h2>

    <p>If you want this to work, you have to be honest about what won't:</p>

    <p><strong>You won't get perfect global coordination.</strong> Aim for chokepoint coordination. If you control the semiconductor supply chain and cloud infrastructure, you control 90% of what matters.</p>

    <p><strong>US–China cooperation will be narrow and transactional.</strong> Structure it like arms control: narrow, verifiable, reciprocal. Don't expect friendship. Expect survivability calculations.</p>

    <p><strong>Enforcement without supply-chain control is fake.</strong> If you can't cut off chips or cloud access, you can't enforce anything. Everything else is theater.</p>

    <p><strong>Governance without democracy will backfire.</strong> Safety authoritarianism won't hold. Democratic publics will reject governance they can't audit or contest. Build legitimacy in from the start, or watch it collapse.</p>

    <p><strong>Waiting for catastrophe is the most dangerous strategy of all.</strong> Post-catastrophe governance will be reactive, authoritarian, and fragmented. Pre-catastrophe governance can be deliberate, legitimate, and coordinated. But only if you build it now.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>9. What Happens If Catastrophe Strikes First?</h2>

    <p>If catastrophe hits before governance is in place, here's what happens:</p>

    <p><strong>Governments scramble with authoritarian clampdowns.</strong> Mass surveillance. Internet lockdowns. AI-driven security states. Not because they're evil, but because they're panicking.</p>

    <p><strong>Global coordination becomes nearly impossible.</strong> Trust evaporates. Instead of measured cooperation, you get fractured blocs and runaway arms races.</p>

    <p><strong>Democracy takes the hit.</strong> Emergency powers don't get rolled back. Temporary measures become permanent. Oversight gets suspended "for security."</p>

    <p><strong>The result:</strong> Less freedom. More instability. No guarantee anyone controls what comes next.</p>

    <p>Post-catastrophe governance is reactive governance. And reactive governance in a crisis defaults to authoritarian.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>10. The Choice</h2>

    <p>AGI governance will either be layered before catastrophe—or imposed after one.</p>

    <p>History suggests only one of those preserves democracy.</p>

    <p>The window for pre-catastrophe governance is narrow. Frontier models are advancing. Corporate deployment is accelerating. National competition is intensifying. If you wait for consensus, you'll get catastrophe instead.</p>

    <p>The International AGI Oversight Agency isn't a utopian fantasy. It's a pragmatic chokepoint strategy applied to compute, supply chains, and deployment power. It's arms control logic for the AI era.</p>

    <p>You don't need perfect global coordination. You need coordination among the players that control the infrastructure. You don't need universal love. You need mutual survival incentives.</p>

    <p>And you need to build it <strong>now</strong>—before the blast radius teaches everyone why they should have.</p>

    <hr>

    <div class="closing">
        <p>The choice is binary: creative layering or creative destruction.</p>
        <p>Choose layering. Democracy depends on it.</p>
